# Image-Recommender
An intelligent image recommendation system based on visual similarity.

Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent image recommendation system that identifies and returns visually similar images from a dataset of approximately 500,000 images. The system is designed to support multiple similarity measures, ensure fast search performance, and provide a modular, well-documented Python implementation.
